# Foundation Mod Manager
A mod manager for ElDewrito 0.7.1 to simplify downloading and installing cosmetic mods.

## Usage
1. Download the latest build from [here](https://github.com/dirkkane/FMM/releases/latest)
2. Extract the .7z file to your ElDewrito installation. (EX: C:\Users\Bob\ElDewrito)
3. Run FMM.exe

Many cosmetic mods are not compatible with each other. So expect there to be issues when using multiple at the same time. If you do find any issues with a mod, please direct any feedback or bug reports for the *mod* to its respective creator. If you have an issue or bug report for FMM itself, please feel free to message me on Discord or create an issue on this repo.

If you would like to add a mod to the FMM library, make a pull request to [the FMM-Mods repository](https://github.com/dirkkane/FMM-Mods), or contact @Dirkkane on [the ElDewrito discord](https://discord.gg/CPc7Gf7TPf).
